## Standard Code Test

Write a program that takes an integer from the user. Return the number multiplied by three. If the user enters a non-integer data type, return the following message:

`Please enter an integer`

**Note**, it is important that if there is a string prompting the user to input a number, then the standard code test should search for a substring match.

Here is one solution to the problem. You can copy/paste it into the IDE if you would like.

```python
num = input("Enter an integer: ")
try:
  num = int(num)
  print(num * 3)
except ValueError:
  print("Please enter an integer")
```

The `try... except` block catches all non-integers passed to the script.
